# Painter-App

Welcome to my painter app. The app overall is simple and easy to use. Once you open the app you will see a white area where you can start
drawing. If you press on the settings button on the top right, a menu with different options will show up. You can tap on the default color
button at the top left to reset the color, or you can press the stroke width button to reset it to the default size. 

You can pick any color with the color picker, and it will be shown in the box to the top right. You can then pick a circle, or rectangle to draw
You can always go back to the brush or you can use the eraser to delete specific parts. 

When you click on one of the 4 middle buttons it will change to blue to signal you have clicked on the button. Shapes will default the stroke
width back to 4, so that it's easier to use. After you are done using the eraser it will return back to the brush and your previous color. 
You can also pick a width between 1-100.
